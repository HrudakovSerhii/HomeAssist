# Email Processing Service Division

## Overview
The original `EmailProcessingService` was too large (797 lines) and had multiple responsibilities. It has been refactored into 4 focused services following the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Service Division

### 1. **EmailScheduleProcessorService** (Main Orchestrator)
**File**: `email-schedule-processor.service.ts`
**Responsibility**: Orchestrate schedule-based email processing
**Key Methods**:
- `processEmailsWithScheduleConfig()` - Main entry point for processing emails with schedule configuration
- `processBatchWithScheduleConfig()` - Process individual batches
- `chunkArray()` - Utility for batching

**Dependencies**: PrismaService, ImapService, EmailPriorityService, EmailAnalysisService, ScheduleExecutionService

### 2. **EmailPriorityService** (Priority Logic)
**File**: `email-priority.service.ts`
**Responsibility**: Handle all priority-related logic and scoring
**Key Methods**:
- `applyUserPriorityPreprocessing()` - Apply user priority rules before LLM processing
- `applyUserPriorityPostprocessing()` - Apply priority adjustments after LLM processing
- `calculateEnhancedPriorityScore()` - Comprehensive priority scoring with breakdown
- All enhanced priority calculation methods (time sensitivity, content type, sender importance, etc.)

**Dependencies**: None (pure business logic)

### 3. **EmailAnalysisService** (LLM Processing)
**File**: `email-analysis.service.ts`
**Responsibility**: Handle LLM processing and email analysis
**Key Methods**:
- `processEmailWithEnhancedPriority()` - Process emails with LLM using schedule preferences
- `selectTemplateByFocus()` - Select appropriate LLM template based on user focus

**Dependencies**: LLMService, TemplateService, ConfigService

### 4. **ScheduleExecutionService** (Execution Tracking)
**File**: `schedule-execution.service.ts`
**Responsibility**: Handle schedule execution progress and storage
**Key Methods**:
- `storeProcessedEmail()` - Store processed emails with execution tracking
- `updateExecutionProgress()` - Update execution progress in database

**Dependencies**: PrismaService

### 5. **EmailProcessingService** (Simplified Wrapper)
**File**: `email-processing.service.ts` (Refactored)
**Responsibility**: Maintain backward compatibility and delegate to new services
**Key Methods**:
- `processEmailsWithScheduleConfig()` - Delegates to EmailScheduleProcessorService

**Dependencies**: EmailScheduleProcessorService

## Benefits of This Division

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 2. **Better Testability**
- Smaller services are easier to unit test
- Dependencies are clearer and can be easily mocked
- Priority logic can be tested independently of LLM processing

### 3. **Improved Reusability**
- `EmailPriorityService` can be used by other services that need priority calculations
- `EmailAnalysisService` can be reused for different types of email analysis
- `ScheduleExecutionService` can be used for any scheduled operations

### 4. **Easier Maintenance**
- Changes to priority logic only affect `EmailPriorityService`
- LLM-related changes are isolated to `EmailAnalysisService`
- Database operations are centralized in `ScheduleExecutionService`

### 5. **Better Dependency Management**
- Clear dependency graph
- Easier to identify circular dependencies
- Services can be developed and tested independently

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: ✅ Complete
- Create new focused services
- Update EmailModule to include all services
- Refactor EmailProcessingService to delegate to new services

### Phase 2: Future (Optional)
- Update controllers/consumers to use specific services directly
- Remove EmailProcessingService wrapper if no longer needed
- Add service-specific interfaces for better abstraction
