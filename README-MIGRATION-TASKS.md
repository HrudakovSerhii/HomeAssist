## Migration Order

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Essential setup)
1. Tailwind Theme Setup
2. Shared Components
3. Auth & State Management

**Phase 2: Screen Implementation** (Feature development)
4. Login Screen
5. Add Account Screen  
6. Dashboard Screen

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing** (Final integration)
7. Complete integration, testing, and deployment

## Key Features Being Migrated

### From login.html/login.js:
- ✅ Login/Register tab interface
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Session storage management
- ✅ Authentication flow with backend API
- ✅ Conditional navigation based on user accounts

### From add-account.html/add-account.js:
- ✅ Email account addition form
- ✅ IMAP connection testing
- ✅ User information display
- ✅ Gmail app password instructions
- ✅ Account validation and error states

### From data-preview.html/data-preview.js:
- ✅ Advanced filtering system (8+ filter types)
- ✅ Sortable data table with expansion
- ✅ Pagination with page navigation
- ✅ Status badges and confidence indicators
- ✅ Loading, error, and empty states
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: React Context API + custom hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Expected Outcomes

### Technical Benefits:
- 🔧 Modern, maintainable React codebase
- 📱 Better mobile responsiveness
- ⚡ Improved performance with code splitting
- 🧪 Comprehensive testing coverage
- 🔄 Better state management
- 🎨 Consistent design system

### User Experience Benefits:
- 🚀 Faster page transitions
- 📱 Better mobile experience
- ♿ Improved accessibility
- 🔄 Smooth loading states
- 💬 Better error messaging
- 🎯 More intuitive navigation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards:
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow React best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Component Architecture:
- Build reusable, composable components
- Use proper prop interfaces
- Implement loading and error states
- Follow single responsibility principle

### Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Accessibility testing

## Getting Started

1. **Review task files** in numerical order
2. **Setup development environment** with Node.js and npm
3. **Start with Task 1** (Tailwind theme setup)
4. **Follow dependency order** (don't skip to later tasks)
5. **Test each task** before moving to the next
6. **Document any deviations** or issues encountered

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues during implementation:
1. Check the specific task file for detailed implementation examples
2. Review the existing HTML/JS/CSS files for reference
3. Ensure all dependencies from previous tasks are completed
4. Test components in isolation before integration

Each task file contains detailed implementation examples, TypeScript interfaces, and success criteria to guide the migration process.
